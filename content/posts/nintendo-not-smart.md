If you were to ask anyone to explain the benefits of owning a Nintendo Switch, we'd argue most would demonstrate the console's ability to 'switch' between handheld and docked play. It's the entire selling point of the system after all, and having a console be so versatile can only be a good thing, right?

<br />

Wrong – well, according to Wedbush Securities' Michael Pachter, anyway. Yes, one of the gaming industry's most high profile analysts has said that Nintendo should scrap the original version of the Switch entirely, and instead focus only on the handheld-only Switch Lite.

<br />

In an interview with GamingBolt, Pachter says, "I don’t really understand the whole hybrid concept... I don’t think most people play it in both modes, I would say that maybe 20% of Switch owners play both modes; and I think most Switch owners play it handheld only. So I honestly don’t understand the whole point of the hybrid. Who cares? Play it as a handheld."

<br />

Things get a little more interesting:

<br />

"And Nintendo isn’t that smart," he continues, "so you never know what they will do next, but I think the smart thing would be to get rid of the Switch console and only have the Switch Lite, get rid of the docking station, get rid of playing on the TV; maybe offer a Fire Stick style dongle for those who do want to play it on the TV."

<br />

So, Nintendo should get rid of a console that's breaking sales records left, right and centre, and release a Fire Stick instead? Hmm.
